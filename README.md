This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Start the app

`npm i`

`node server/server.js`

### To make changes

Make changes in src, run `npm run build` to rebuild the bundle. (Horrible local working environment I know! Given more time I'd build a better hot-reloading dev environment with dummy data)

### TODO

tests
error handling

Didnt have time for these :(
